            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The Town of Firestone's boards, commissions and committees have specific responsibilities as detailed in the Town municipal code, code of ordinances and the enacting resolution. Each board and commission makes recommendations to the Board of Trustees and staff on matters related to its area of responsibility.  Appointments for boards, commissions or committees are made in even years with varying terms depending on the group. <br>Becoming a member of a board, commission or committee is a great way to become active in the decision-making process of Town government. Serving also offers residents an opportunity to provide expertise in areas of individual interest. All positions are voluntary and vary in length of terms and time commitments. <br> All appointees to Town of Firestone boards, commissions and committees must be residents of the Town. Applicants for final decision making boards cannot have financial interest in a contract with the Town. All appointed board, commission and committee members adhere to a code of conduct. All appointments are made at the discretion of the Town Board of Trustees.<br><a href="join.html">Join the Chamber of Commerce</a></p>
